**Kafka-Java Integration**

This repo contains -

- Kafka Producer
- Kafka Consumer
- Kafka Broker Failover
- Kafka Partition Key
- Kafka Consumer Group
- Kafka Producer Callback

**Prerequisites**

You should have a running Kafka cluster

In my case, I setup Kafka cluster with 3 brokers running in my local machine at below ports -\

localhost:9091

localhost:9092

localhost:9093

You can clone this repo and check 
Kafka producer, 
consumer, 
broker failover, 
sending messages with partition key, 
scaling Kafka consumers with Consumer Group,
Producer callback

Happy Coding!!!
